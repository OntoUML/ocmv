## The OntoUML/UFO Catalog

The **OntoUML/UFO Catalog** is a structured and open-source catalog that contains OntoUML and UFO ontology models. It was conceived to allow collaborative work and to be easily accessible to all its users. Its goal is to support empirical research in OntoUML and UFO, as well as for the general conceptual modeling area, by providing high-quality curated, structured, and machine-processable data on *why*, *where*, and *how* different modeling approaches are used.
