# Metadata

The [OntoUML/UFO Catalog Metadata Vocabulary](https://w3id.org/ontouml-models/vocabulary) was created to satisfy the metadata needs of the OntoUML/UFO Catalog, complementing the catalog's schema.

The catalog’s schema, depicted in the image above, reuses classes and properties from the following RDF/OWL vocabularies:

- [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)](http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat): The central vocabulary in our metadata schema, DCAT was “*designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web*”.
- [Dublin Core Terms (DCT)](http://purl.org/dc/terms/): A vocabulary that defines properties to describe basic metadata of resources on the web.
- [Friend of a Friend (FOAF)](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1): A vocabulary that offers terms to describe people, groups, companies, and other types of agents.
- [Metadata for Ontology Description and Publication (MOD)](https://w3id.org/mod/2.0): A vocabulary that defines properties to describe the metadata of ontologies and other semantic artefacts.
- [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core): A vocabulary for representing and linking knowledge organization systems.
- [vCard](http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns): A vocabulary to describe contact information (e.g., email, phone number).

All externally defined properties are here commented to indicate their specific usage in the context of the OntoUML/UFO Catalog.
